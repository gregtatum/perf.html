/**
 * This definition was built from a combination of:
 * - https://stuk.github.io/jszip/documentation
 * - The source code
 * - And observing the console.
 *
 * It is not meant to be exhaustive, but just enough to be useful for how the unzipping
 * functionality is used. The interface is really funky with a function that is also
 * an object, so just export a function, and an object, then coerce the usage into
 * the proper version.
 *
 * e.g.
 *
 * import JSZip from 'jszip';
 * const zip = (JSZip: InitJSZip)();
 * const zip = (JSZip: StaticJSZip).loadAsync();
